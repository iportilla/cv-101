# CV101: Computer Vision Fundamentals

This repo includes hands-on Jupyter notebooks to learn computer vision using OpenCV on macOS (Apple Silicon) and NVIDIA GPUs.

## Notebooks

- `cv101-week1.ipynb` – Starter: load and process images
- `cv101-week1-full.ipynb` – Full GPU-optional solution with CUDA hooks
- `cv101-week1-apple.ipynb` – Apple Silicon optimized version

## Setup

```bash
conda env create -f environment.yml
conda activate cv101
jupyter lab
```

##Sample Image

Place any image you want to test inside `/images/bananas.jpg`.
