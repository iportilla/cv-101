# üçè Week 1: Computer Vision on Apple Silicon (M1/M2/M3/M4)

In this notebook, you'll explore basic image processing tasks using OpenCV on Apple Silicon Macs.

With an M-series chip, you benefit from hardware-accelerated libraries like Metal and CoreML. We‚Äôll keep our code compatible and optimized.

We'll:
- Load and visualize an image
- Convert to grayscale and blur
- Perform edge detection
- Optionally, export to CoreML model (bonus!)
